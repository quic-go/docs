## Using `ListenAndServeQUIC`

The easiest way to start an HTTP/3 server is using
```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
// ... add HTTP handlers to mux ...
// If mux is nil, the http.DefaultServeMux is used.
http3.ListenAndServeQUIC("0.0.0.0:443", "/path/to/cert", "/path/to/key", mux)
```

## Setting up a `http3.Server`

For more configurability, set up an `http3.Server` explicitly:
```go
server := http3.Server{
	Handler:    mux,
	Addr:       "0.0.0.0:443",
	TLSConfig:  http3.ConfigureTLSConfig(&tls.Config{}), // use your tls.Config here
	QUICConfig: &quic.Config{},
}
err := server.ListenAndServe()
```

`http3.ConfigureTLSConfig` takes a `tls.Config` and configures the `GetConfigForClient` such that the correct ALPN value for HTTP/3 is used.

## Using a `quic.Transport`

It is also possible to manually set up a `quic.Transport`, and then pass the listener to the server. This is useful when you want to set configuration options on the `quic.Transport`.
```go
tr := quic.Transport{Conn: conn}
tlsConf := http3.ConfigureTLSConfig(&tls.Config{})  // use your tls.Config here
quicConf := &quic.Config{} // QUIC connection options
server := http3.Server{}
ln, _ := tr.ListenEarly(tlsConf, quicConf)
err := server.ServeListener(ln)
```

### Demultiplexing non-HTTP Protocols

Alternatively, it is also possible to pass fully established QUIC connections to the HTTP/3 server. This is useful if the QUIC serves both HTTP/3 and other protocols. Connection can then be demultiplexed using the ALPN value (via `NextProtos` in the `tls.Config`).
```go
tr := quic.Transport{Conn: conn}
tlsConf := http3.ConfigureTLSConfig(&tls.Config{})  // use your tls.Config here
quicConf := &quic.Config{} // QUIC connection options
server := http3.Server{}
ln, _ := tr.ListenEarly(tlsConf, quicConf)
for {
	c, _ := ln.Accept()
	switch c.ConnectionState().TLS.NegotiatedProtocol {
	case http3.NextProtoH3:
		go server.ServeQUICConn(c) 
	// ... handle other protocols ...  
	}
}
```

## Advertising HTTP/3 via Alt-Svc

An HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 server can advertise that it is also offering the same resources on HTTP/3 using [HTTP Alternative Services](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7838#section-3) (Alt-Svc) header field. [Section 3.1.1 of RFC 9114](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#section-3.1.1) specifies how to use this field to advertise support for HTTP/3.

This allows HTTP clients to discover support for HTTP/3. Clients may still continue using the existing HTTP connection on top of TCP, but might decide to connect via QUIC the next time.

An `http.Handler` can be wrapped to automatically add the Alt-Svc header field for non-HTTP/3 requests:
```go
server := http3.Server{}
var handler http.Handler = http.NewServeMux()
// ... add HTTP handlers ...
handler = http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.ProtoMajor < 3 {
		err := server.SetQUICHeaders(w.Header())
		// ... handle error ...
	}
	handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)
})
```

### Reverse-Proxying

If the HTTP/3 server is located behind an L4 reverse proxy, it might be listening on a different UDP port than the port that is exposed to the internet. To accomodate for this common scenario, the external port can be configured using the `Port` field of the `http3.Server`:
```go
server := http3.Server{
	Port: 443, // SetQUICHeaders will now generate the Alt-Svc header for port 443
}
```

More complex scenarios can be handled by manually setting the Alt-Svc header field, or by overwriting the value added by `SetQUICHeaders`.

## 0-RTT

By default, the `http3.Server` enables 0-RTT support on the QUIC layer, thereby allowing clients to send requests using 0-RTT. When using a user-provided `quic.Config`, 0-RTT is only enabled when the `Allow0RTT` config flag is set.

An `http.Handler` can determine if a request was likely sent in 0-RTT by examining the `tls.ConnectionState` associated with the request.
```go
func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	wasLikely0RTT := !r.TLS.HandshakeComplete
}
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  This is not a 100% reliable way of telling if a request was (fully or partially) sent in 0-RTT data. The `tls.ConnectionState` is obtained from the `quic.Connection` when the request stream is accepted. There's a race condition here: The QUIC STREAM frames might have been sent in 0-RTT, but the handshake could have completed before the HTTP/3 was able to accept the stream.
