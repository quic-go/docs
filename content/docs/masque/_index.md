We currently don't support any of the protocols developed by the [IETF MASQUE working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/masque/about/), but we're planning to implement CONNECT-UDP ([RFC 9298](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9298)) soon. The work is tracked in issue [#4393](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/4393).
